PASSIVE 

KILL BOSSES GET STACKS

PRIMARY

CHARGE AND FIRE BOW, AUTO FIRES AT HIGH ATTACKSPEEDS. THREE HIT COMBO STACKING THAT CAUSES THE SPIRIT TO LUNGE AT THE TARGET OR SOME SHIT.

SECONDARY 

HOP AND FIRE OUT 3 ARROWS AT NEARBY ENEMIES. ARROWS DO NOT APPLY THE THREE HIT COMBO BULLSHIT. SPIRIT FIRES OUT WISPS WITH YOU (2 WISPS)

UTILITY

Swap locations with your spirit and explode at each others location firing off wisps to home in on enemies. 

SPECIAL

REDIRECT YOUR SPIRIT TO A TARGETED LOCATION CAUSING THEM TO FRENZY. BEING WITHIN x METERS OF THEM LOWERS YOUR SECONDARY COOLDOWN to 2 SECONDS. WHEN FRENZY ENDS, YOUR SPIRIT RETURNS TO YOU


SPIRIT BEHAVIOUR

Out of combat, linger near lamb

if in combat but lamb does not apply 3 stacks, he will not fight

in combat, attack nearest enemy with bite.

when 3 stacks happens, spirit will lunge at the target. Damage can be directly applied without him doing shit so its buttery smooth

When lamb leaps, he fires off two wisps

when swapped, continue to attack shit nearby

when redirected, he dashes to the location and begins to attack shit like a boss

when special ends, he is teleported back
